# The Multimodal Storyteller ü™∂

An interactive, AI-powered storytelling application built with Streamlit. Forge a unique world, guide the narrative through your choices, and see your story come to life with AI-generated art and audio narration.

##  Features

-   **Dynamic World Generation:** Start by creating a unique "World Bible" based on a theme, a protagonist archetype, and a core contradiction. This guide ensures the AI maintains a consistent tone and lore.
-   **Interactive Narrative:** After each story segment, you are presented with three choices to guide the plot. Two are logical progressions, but one is a "Wildcard" designed to introduce surprising twists.
-   **AI-Generated Artwork:** Each chapter of your story is accompanied by a unique piece of art, generated by an AI based on the narrative you just co-created.
-   **Text-to-Speech Narration:** Listen to your entire saga unfold with built-in browser-based text-to-speech, bringing an auditory dimension to your creation.
-   **Stateful Experience:** The app remembers your entire story, the world you built, and your choices, ensuring a cohesive and continuous adventure.

##  Tech Stack & Architecture

This project orchestrates multiple AI services to create a seamless multimodal experience.

-   **Framework:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the interactive web application UI.
-   **Narrative Engine:** [Google Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://ai.google.dev/) is used as the "Storyteller Brain." It generates the world bible, writes narrative chapters, and proposes the next plot choices based on the story's context.
-   **Image Generation Model:** [Stable Diffusion v1.6](https://stability.ai/). We use the official **[Stability.ai API](https://platform.stability.ai/)** for fast, reliable, and high-quality image generation.
-   **Text-to-Speech:** The browser's native `window.speechSynthesis` Web API.
-   **Core Language:** Python

### How It Works

The application follows a simple but powerful loop:

1.  **User Choice:** The user selects a path for the story to take.
2.  **Gemini as Director:** The entire story context and the user's choice are sent to the Gemini model. Gemini acts as a director, returning a structured JSON object containing:
    -   `narrative_chapter`: The next story segment.
    -   `next_choices`: Three new plot choices for the user.
    -   `image_prompt`: A descriptive prompt for an image generator, based on the new narrative.
3.  **Stability.ai as Artist:** The app takes the `image_prompt` from Gemini and sends it to the Stability.ai API.
4.  **UI Update:** The Streamlit app receives the generated image, displays it alongside the new narrative chapter, and presents the new choices to the user, ready for the next cycle.

##  Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer
-   `pip` for package installation

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Karthik-1221/Multimodal-story-Teller-V2.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure API Keys:**
    You need API keys from Google and Stability.ai.
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project folder.
    -   Add your keys to this file in the following format:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"
    STABILITY_API_KEY="your_stability_api_key_here"
    ```

    -   **Google API Key:** Get it from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
    -   **Stability API Key:** Get it from your [DreamStudio Account](https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys). New accounts receive free credits for development.

### Running the Application

Once your `.env` file is set up, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```


Usage

    Forge Your World: On the first screen, select a theme, archetype, and contradiction to generate the world's lore.

    Begin Your Saga: Write the opening sentence of your story.

    Weave the Story: In the main story cycle, read the latest chapter, admire the artwork, and choose one of the three paths to continue. Click "Weave Next Chapter" to proceed.

    Narrate: Use the narration buttons to play, pause, or stop the text-to-speech audio of your story.

    Restart: To start a brand new saga from scratch, use the "Start a New Saga (Restart)" button at the bottom.
